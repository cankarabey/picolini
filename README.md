A smart plant pot powered by the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 (C SDK)

## Description

This is a hobby project aiming to build a smart pot equiped with a range of sensor for tracking the conditions of the plant. Currently, the Pico is connected to a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, GY-302 for light intensity in lumen, unknown AliExpress water sensor for detecting water on the bottom of the pot and unknown AliExpress soil moisture sensor for measuring soil moisture. The sensor readings are displayed on a SSD1306 128x32 OLED screen.
